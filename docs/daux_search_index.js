For Arch Linux, The package invidtui-bin is in the AUR. Install it using an AUR helper of your choice like so: &lt;aur-helper&gt; -S invidtui-bin. #Releases You can retrieve the package\u2019s tagged release from the project\u2019s Releases page. Before downloading, note: The latest tag of the release Your operating system (for example, Linux) Your architecture (for example, x86_64) The binary is packaged in a gzipped tar file (with the extension .tar.gz) in the format: invidtui_&lt;tag&gt;_&lt;Operating System&gt;_&lt;Architecture&gt;.tar.gz To download a package for: with the release tag \u2018v0.3.2\u2019, a \u2018Linux\u2019 distribution, on the \u2018x86_64\u2019 architecture, You would select: invidtui_0.3.2_Linux_x86_64.tar.gz You can follow these steps for other Operating Systems as well. Note that for Apple computers like Macs, the Operating System is Darwin. #GO Toolchain Ensure that the go binary is present in your system before following the listed steps. #Install To install it directly from the repository without having to compile anything, use: go install github.com\/darkhz\/invidtui@latest Note that the installed binary may be present in ~\/go\/bin, so ensure that your $PATH points to that directory as well. #Compile Clone the source into a folder using git, like so: git clone https:\/\/github.com\/darkhz\/invidtui\/ The source should be cloned into a directory named \u201cinvidtui\u201d. Next, change the directory to the \u201cinvidtui\u201d folder: cd invidtui Finally, use the go toolchain to build the project: go build main.go -o invidtui-bin After the build process, a binary named \u201cinvidtui-bin\u201d should be present in your current directory.","tags":"","url":"Installation.html"},{"title":"Configuration","text":"Generally, invidtui will work out-of-the-box, with no configuration required. In case you need to specify settings without using command-line options, a config file can be used. Typing invidtui --help will show you the location of the config file. The configuration file is in the HJSON format. You can use the \u2013generate flag to generate the configuration. For example: { download-dir: &quot;~\/Downloads&quot; ffmpeg-path: ffmpeg force-instance: &quot;invidious.protokolla.fi&quot; mpv-path: mpv num-retries: 10 video-res: 720p ytdl-path: youtube-dl keybindings: { Menu: Alt+m } } #Keybindings The keybinding configuration is a list of KeybindingType: keybinding values. While defining keybindings, the global keybindings must not conflict with the non-global ones. It is possible to have duplicate keybindings amongst various non-global keybindings. For example, this is allowed: keybindings: { QueuePlayMove: Alt+E SearchSwitchMode: Alt+E } But this isn\u2019t: keybindings: { Menu: Alt+m Dashboard: Alt+m } #Modifiers The modifiers currently supported for keybindings are Ctrl, Alt and Shift. Shift should only be used in rare cases. For example, instead of : Shift+a, type A Alt+Shift+e, type Alt+E and so on. For the space and the \u2018+\u2019 characters, type Space and Plus respectively. For example, keybindings: { PlayerInfo: Ctrl+Space Add: Ctrl+Plus } #Types Note that some keybinding combinations may be valid, but may not work due to the way your terminal\/environment handles it.

Make sure the search queries are properly quoted. For example: invidtui --search-video &quot;linux&quot; #show-instances This option can be used to list active Invidious instances. #token The token and token-link options have to be used along with the force-instance option.
