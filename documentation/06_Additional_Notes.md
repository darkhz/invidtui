- Since Youtube video titles may have many unicode characters (emojis for example), it is recommended to install **noto-fonts** and its variants (noto-fonts-emoji for example). Refer to your distro's documentation on how to install them. On Arch Linux for instance, you can install the fonts using pacman:
  `pacman -S noto-fonts noto-fonts-emoji noto-fonts-extra`<br/>

- For the video mode, only MP4 videos will be played, and currently there is no way to modify this behavior. This will change in later versions.

- On Windows, using invidtui in Powershell/CMD will work, but use Windows Terminal for best results.

- For certain videos where the duration is shown as "00:00", but the published date is greater than 0s, it is most likely that the video is a live stream. Due to certain inconsistencies with the invidious API, such videos are not shown as live streams in the search results, but will show when playing.

- Since invidtui relies on specially crafted URLs to load and display media properly, it is not recommended to edit the autogenerated playlist.

- MPRIS support can be enabled by installing [mpv-mpris](https://github.com/hoyon/mpv-mpris).
