# General usage
To start invidtui, type:

```
invidtui
```

and the application will initialize, and load a screen like this:

![start_screen](../images/03_Usage/start_screen.png)

Then, the following methods can be used to navigate within the application:
- [Menu](../04_Pages/_index.md#Menu)
- [Keybindings](../03_Usage/02_Keybindings)

See the [Pages](../04_Pages/_index.md) section for more details.

The Invidious instance is selected automatically, and can be [changed](../03_Usage/02_Keybindings/01_Global_Keybindings.md#App).

# Command-line options
To launch invidtui with preset options, you can use the command-line options, which you can view
either by checking the [Command line options](../03_Usage/01_Command_Line_Options.md) section or by invoking:

```
invidtui --help
```

which will print a list of options with their brief description.
