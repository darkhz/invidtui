# Text User Interface
The TUI was designed using [tview](https://www.github.com/rivo/tview),  which in turn uses [tcell](https://www.github.com/gdamore/tcell).

Thank you, [rivo](https://www.github.com/rivo) and [gdamore](https://www.github.com/gdamore), for these wonderful libraries.

## Progress bars
[progressbar](https://www.github.com/schollz/progressbar) is used to render progress bars

# Configuration and Command-line handling
[koanf](https://www.github.com/knadh/koanf) is used to parse the HJSON configuration and the command-line parameters.

## Text Printing
[yacspin](https://www.github.com/theckman/yacspin) is used to print colored text and spinners to the terminal.

# MPV IPC
[mpvipc](https://github.com/dexterlb/mpvipc) is used to communicate with [MPV](https://mpv.io).
